This repository contains course materials, including notes, code examples, and assignments for the **Fundamental of Java Programming ** course.

## üìú Course Description

This course is designed to introduce students to the basic concepts and techniques of programming. It covers major aspects of software development, including the use of flowcharts, pseudocode, and NS Diagrams. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to preparing students for object-oriented programming and more advanced Java programming concepts. The primary goal is to equip students with the fundamental skills needed to develop meaningful and effective programs.

## üìö Course Content Outline

This course is structured into the following key topics:
